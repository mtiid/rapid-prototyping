Machine Specs
-------------
File Support   : EAGLE .brd, Gerbers, .svg and G-code file formats.

Working Volume : 5.5 x 4.5 x 1.6  in
                 140 x 114 x 40.6 mm

Materials
---------
Some materials work great all the time, other should only be messed 
with if you know what you are doing. Let this be the guide.

Work Great:

FR-1 circuit boards
Machining wax
Soft and medium-hard wood (birch plywood)
Linoleum
Machinable foam

Soft plastics (for engraving)
Brass (for engraving)
Aluminum (for engraving)
Silver (for engraving)

Need to do some research before using these:

Hard plastics (Delrin, HDPE)
Aluminum
Brass
Hardwood (mahogany)
Soft stone (soapstone)
Leather (for engraving)

NEVER USE THESE:
Steel, stainless or otherwise
Iron
Magnesium
Titanium
Fiberglass
Hard stone
Glass
Silver chloride (or other powdery materials)
Chocolate, cheese, food, etc.


Workflow
--------
The Mill can be used with either the iMAC or with your own personal
Windows or Mac laptop. If you do use your own machine make sure to
download the Otherplan software from Other Machine Co before proceeding.

1. Design your PCB in EAGLE CAD. The Othermill can handle 
    boards generated from other sources, but we will assume 
    you are using EAGLE.

Tips
----
When cutting harder materials, use shallower cuts to protect the machine.

If cutting a small, deep hole, make sure that the flutes on 
the tools is at least as deep as the hole.

When milling large areas sometimes it can be beneficial to 
use large and small tools to increase tooling time.
