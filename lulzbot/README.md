// LulzBot

The 3D printer that is living in the vault is a LulzBot
Taz.

The Windows desktop this also resides in the vault is the control
center for the printer. The Vault also contains at least one
bit full of filament. There is also a drawer in the vault that houses various replacement
parts and tools for repairing the printer.

Take special note of the filament that the printer is currently using and
the type a filament you are about to use: using the incorrect printer settings
can cause damage to the extruder.
